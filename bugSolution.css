The corrected CSS code ensures that the pseudo-element selectors (`::before` and `::after`) are correctly applied to the intended target element. This is typically done by ensuring the selector precisely targets the element and applies the necessary styling within its scope.  Adjustments might involve modifying the selector's specificity or restructuring the HTML to achieve the desired effect.  For example, if a parent element needs to style its children with pseudo-elements, the selector must be accurate to address the correct element.

Example of corrected CSS:

```css
.container::before {
  content: "Before";
  /*other styles*/
}

.container::after {
  content: "After";
  /*other styles*/
}
```
In this corrected example, we ensure that `::before` and `::after` are correctly attached to `.container`.  In the buggy version, this might have been applied to a wrong element or nested improperly, preventing the expected styling from taking effect.
