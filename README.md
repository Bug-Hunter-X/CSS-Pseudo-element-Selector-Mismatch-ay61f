# CSS Pseudo-element Selector Mismatch

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in CSS related to the misapplication of pseudo-element selectors (::before and ::after).  The bug is characterized by an unexpected absence of styling on an element when a pseudo-element selector is intended to style it. This often happens due to a misunderstanding of the selector's scope or incorrect nesting of elements.

The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.

This bug highlights the importance of careful selector usage, particularly with pseudo-elements, and demonstrates how seemingly minor errors can lead to significant styling issues.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` (or create a simple HTML file using the appropriate selectors) in a web browser.
3. Observe the rendered output and compare the expected styling with the actual styling.

## Solution

Examine the corrected code in `bugSolution.css` to understand the correct application of the pseudo-element selectors.  Pay attention to the selector specificity and the parent-child relationship between the elements.
